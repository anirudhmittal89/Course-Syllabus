    "1. In this Problem, you will simulate Galton’s box – a machine in which steel balls are dropped through rows of pins.  As a ball hits each pin, it can move to the right or to the left by half a space with equal probability as it falls to the next row.  A sample path is shown in the diagram below.   At the bottom of the box, pinballs are collected in lanes, numbered 0 to N-1.\n",

    "a. First, write a Pinball class to represent each ball.  Use a position attribute to store the horizontal position of the ball.  Include a bounce() method that adds or subtracts ½ from the position with equal probability.  Your class should implement the following behavior:\n",

    "b. Next, write a Board class to represent Galton’s box.  Pass the number of lanes, N, into the constructor.  Include a method insert_pinball that takes a Pinball as its argument, sets the position to (N-1)/2, makes the ball bounce N-1 times, and remembers which lane it falls into.  Continuing the shell example above, your classes should implement the following behavior:\n",
