# Questions From This Week's Work

This is a repository of the questions that come up during this week. This should be a fairly open forum.

## Dealing with Babun and Windows

Hopefully Shawn can contribute to the discussion. He has a windows machine and got it working.

## Differences between Windows and Mac Command Lines

My understanding: basically windows long ago made the bet that the majority of applications would be GUI based. Therefore they optimized for that use case rather than trying to focus on building out the command line which was a staple of Unix/Linux which started in the server world. Mac OS X is built on top of Unix and therefore uses virtually all of the same commands [roughly speaking]. Therefore the general file structure is the same and it makes it easier for people to recycle what they use. A shell script that works on mac is likely to work on a server [again very crudely speaking]. Just built for different purposes.
