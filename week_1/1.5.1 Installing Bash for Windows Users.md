# Windows Users: Install Bash
-----

If you are a Windows user, please take this moment to download and install a bash shell.  

**Note:** This step is not needed for Mac computers, which have a built-in bash console called the Terminal.  Users of Linux and other Unix-like operating systems can also use their native command line prompt.

Our favorite bash shell for windows is Babun.  You can download [Babun here](http://babun.github.io).

Click on the Download button, extract the zip folder, double click the babun folder and run the install batch file. A black command will popup copying a number of files to your computer. This takes around five minutes so give it some time to fully install.

After installation completes, you should have the Babun command prompt running. If not, there should be a shortcut on the desktop where you can run Babun. Double click that shortcut. Whenever we ask you to use the command line in this class, please open Babun.

Now that we are looking at the Babun command line, type the command

```
pwd
```

This stands for print working directory.  It tells you where you are working in your computers file structure.


## Navigating to the Desktop

Often in this course, we will ask you to navigate to your desktop from the command line.  This is a little bit trickier in your windows shell, because it starts you out in a special folder:

```
C:\Users\[your username]\.babun\cygwin\home\[your username]
```

To navigate to the desktop, you must enter the `cd` command, which stands for change directory.
